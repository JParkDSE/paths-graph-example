Yaml found in the ebdse/activities directory is used by ebdse to generate realistic data for the offers graph. Note that it consists of inserting vertex - edge - vertex groups at a time and is configurable using command line arguments. These command line arguments are bash variables in the `runebdse` script provided with the asset. By tweaking these variable values, we can generate larger or smaller graphs.
